# Data Model

[TODO: rev, cas, sessions, locks, predicates, ephemeral files, cacheing]

files in a tree structure; each file name can contain
only ASCII numerals and letters, `.`, and `-`. Files
are uniquely identified by a path consisting of file
names starting from the root directory, separated by
the `/` symbol.
